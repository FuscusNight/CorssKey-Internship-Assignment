# CorssKey-Internship-Assignment
 My internship assignmet for Crosskey 2024 Summer

 Information About The Application : 

 - The Project Strucutre is set to Java 21 in IntellJ IDEA 
 - MAVEN was used as the build tool
 - A Unit TEST exists in which values can be asserted into for quick testing if the program is working correctly.
 - No Java.math dependencies were used
 
 To start the application either simply run it via your preffered coding software such as IntellJ IDEA , OR :
 - There is a JAR file which can be run with a .bat file or an .exe file inside of the target directory to run the program , this was not required from the assignment but i wanted to do it. 
 I thought of packing in a JAVA 17 wrapper with said exe as it is the minimum needed to run the program but that would have increased this github to around 200 MBs which would be unnecesary bloat currently for this assignment since it was neither a base requirement to do or even an optional so i refrained from doing it.

 - The program should meet the requirements as specified in the pdf i was given.
 I have also achieved an optional objective of creating a dockerfile which i created with command prompts and tested as an image via docker desktop and it worked , it is something i have not done before as we have not covered it yet in the university but it didn't take too much to get the hang of.

 Other optional two optinal objectives of using cloud services such as AWS to host the docker or creating and designing a website that utilizes the JAVA code i have't done , partially due to time constraints with other university duties latelty and also due to not really having experience or been taught even in the uni yet how to do this exactly as cloud servers will come later in the spring for me, similarly to the docker situation but the docker was not an issue to learn fairly quickly and get familirized with it.

 I hope my code is satisfactory enough and thank you for taking your time to evaluate my work for an internship position.
